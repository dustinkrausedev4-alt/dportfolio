      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a Site Reliability Engineer with over a decade of experience designing, automating, and scaling
        reliable, secure, and high-performance cloud infrastructure. I began as a software developer and
        evolved into DevOps and SRE roles, mastering tools like AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, Go,
        and CI/CD pipelines.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy solving complex problems — from improving observability and performance to building automation
        systems that reduce manual toil. My goal is to create resilient infrastructure that empowers development
        teams to deliver faster and more confidently.
